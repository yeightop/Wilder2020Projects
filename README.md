HUNTER WILDER PROJECTS


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUESSWHO-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only files needed: GuessWho.java, CharacterList.java, Character.java, RandomPermutation.java, AlteredSW.txt
Runner File: GuessWho.java

Note: downloaded from repl and didnt want to delete any files without being able to run it after(im paranoid i guess)

Code all commented
The game runs, functons, and ends

Small Problems:
  Sometimes you need to hit enter twice to move on
  If you type in help it will prompt you to respond YES or NO that you did type in help(you can say yes or no to this)
  
      *'help' is seen as a guess. I made it not add on to guesses but it still responds to it like it is a players question
      
  Sometimes it with think you hit enter when you were being asked a question and it will tell you "they asked ______"  and tell you say if its true or not(you can say yes or   no for this too)
  
  The computer guesses it's character really fast
  
  When versing the computer and you ask a question it will tell you that you asked that question and to say if its true or not(just hit enter for this)

I am turning in GuessWho EARLY(12/9-11.01pm)

PASSWORD MANAGER-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Nate combined our code for the most part so refer to him for what files are important
  
  I made our user login and file creation system
  
  We struggle a little bit with getting a password generator from Pat
  
  I believe it is very good and meets most if not all of the reqirements
  
  I did complete my part and my user creation and login works fine but something goes wrong in the password generator that we werent able to fix in time

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GDRITYS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This may be the lowest quality one

-I set up the nav drawer activity and did the main welcome screen, the Sandwich meanu, Ice Cream Scream menu and the checkout menu | Pat was responsible for the Chili, Salad & Others, Sides | Nate was out guy for passing information betweeb the menus because he was the one in our group that understood it the best.

-I didn't get anything from pat for the xml he was supposed to do and nate was able to get our data passing between screens working in time 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MadLib---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe it should all be in order

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In conclusion:
We didn't communicate super well on these projects and it was difficult communicating with Pat since he was remote for so long. We all have different skill levels and understanding so it was hard to divide the work up.
