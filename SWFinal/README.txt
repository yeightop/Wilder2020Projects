Code all commented
The game runs, functons, and ends

Small Problems:
  -Sometime you need to hit enter twice to move on
  -If you type in help it will prompt you to respond YES or NO that you did type in help(you can say yes or no to this)
      *'help' is seen as a guess. I made it not add on to guesses but it still responds to it like it is a players question
  -Sometimes it with think you hit enter when you were being asked a question and it will tell you "they asked ______"  and tell you say if its true or not(you can say yes or no for this too)
  -The computer guesses it's character really fast
  -When versing the computer and you as a question it will tell you that you asked that question and to say if its true or not(just hit enter for this)

I am turning in GuessWho EARLY
